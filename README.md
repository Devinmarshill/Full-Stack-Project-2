# Full-Stack-Project-2-

Paragraph 1: What was the assignment or task?

The task for this group project was to create project management app. We created it to learn how to use PM application in our future jobs, and how to potentially create one that exceeds those existing in the current market. 

Paragraph 2: What was our motivation?

Our motivation behind building this project was to develop a user-friendly project management app that provided what others in the field could not. We wanted to enhance the user experience, as well as understand the ropes behind project management apps and sites.  

Paragraph 3: What problem does it solve?

Our project management app allows you to create a profile and keep track of all your projects, as well as the projects of your teammates and those in your companies, if they give you access. It allows the teams to stay connected during projects and fill in where work is needed to be done.

Paragraph 4: What did we learn? Why did we build this project?

Through building this project, we learned several valuable lessons. Firstly, we enhanced our skills in frontend web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface. We also gained experience working with APIs. The project allowed us to apply our knowledge of project management applications and integration into the real world. Additionally, we improved our collaboration and communication skills as we worked together as a team to divide tasks, share ideas, and ensure the successful completion of the project.
